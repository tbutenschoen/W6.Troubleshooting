# **Troubleshooting 6 | MUST 4707**
## **Finding and Fixing Errors in WebAudio Code**

In this assignment, you will debug and fix errors in the provided `script.js` file. The file contains **two errors** that prevent the **WebAudio-based synthesizer** from functioning correctly. Your task is to **identify, diagnose, and resolve these issues** so that the synthesizer works as intended.

### **Troubleshooting**

Troubleshooting is the process of **identifying, diagnosing, and resolving errors** in a system. In programming, this involves systematically analyzing symptoms, testing potential causes, and applying solutions. Troubleshooting is an essential skill for software development, debugging, and problem-solving in real-world applications.

### **Task Description**

1. The provided **`index.html` file is correct**—you do **not** need to edit it.
2. The provided **`script.js` file contains two errors** preventing the synthesizer from working properly.
3. Your task is to **identify and fix** these errors.
4. Once fixed, the synthesizer should meet the following requirements:
    - The **Play/Stop button** should correctly toggle the oscillator.
    - The **Gain slider** should adjust the volume in real-time.
    - The **Waveform dropdown** should update the oscillator waveform when changed.

---

### **Coding Instructions**

- Edit **`script.js`** to correct syntax and logic errors.
- Use **console logs** and the **JavaScript Console** in your browser to help debug.
- Ensure that the synthesizer behaves as expected.

---

### **Testing Your Work (Using VS Code and Your Browser)**

1. Make sure you have saved all of your files.
2. Open **`index.html`** in your browser.
3. Open the **JavaScript Console** (Right-click > Inspect > Console).
4. Click **"Play"** to start the oscillator and test the gain slider.
5. Change the waveform and verify that the sound updates correctly.

*If the synthesizer does not behave as expected or shows errors in the console, return to your code and debug it. Repeat this process until the synthesizer functions correctly.*

### **Submission Steps**

1. Submit a URL to your GitHub Repo

### **Expected Outcome (Once Fixed)**

- Clicking **"Play"** starts the oscillator, and clicking **"Stop"** turns it off.
- Moving the **Gain slider** adjusts the volume smoothly.
- Changing the **Waveform dropdown** updates the sound in real time.
